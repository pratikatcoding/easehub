# 🎓 StudentSync: Smart Hostel Ecosystem

> *Revolutionizing the student living experience by bridging the gap between students and service providers.*

## 💡 The Problem
In most colleges, hostel, mess, and laundry systems operate in silos using manual registers. This leads to:
1.  **Food Wastage:** Mess contractors don't know how many students will eat.
2.  **Lost Laundry:** Manual tagging leads to misplaced clothes.
3.  **Slow Maintenance:** Hostel complaints take days to reach the warden.

## 🎯 The Solution
**StudentSync** is a unified web/app platform that connects:
* **Students:** Who need easy access to services.
* **Wardens:** Who need to manage discipline and rooms.
* **Service Providers:** Who need to track demand (Food/Laundry).

## ✨ Modules

### 1. Smart Mess (Food) 🍎
* **Pre-booking:** Students mark "Eating" or "Not Eating" 4 hours prior, reducing food waste.
* **Calorie Tracker:** Basic nutritional info for health-conscious students.

### 2. E-Hostel (Accommodation) 🏠
* **Digital Attendance:** Biometric or Geolocation based nightly attendance.
* **Asset Management:** Inventory tracking for room furniture.

### 3. QuickClean (Laundry) 👕
* **Bag ID Tracking:** Unique ID for every laundry bag.
* **SMS Alerts:** Automated message when clothes are ironed and ready.
